Plan Features:
Include “Notify Me,” push alerts, live stock updates, and wishlist tracking.

Design Wireframes:
Sketch app flow (Home → Product → Notify → Cart → Checkout).

Develop UX:
Add clear navigation, visual alerts, and personalized notification panels.

Test with Users:
Check ease of use, notification timing, and satisfaction.
